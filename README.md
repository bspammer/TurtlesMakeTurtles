Turtles Build Turtles
====

A collection of scripts I found on my hard drive after forgetting about this project from 2016.

Beginnings of an attempt to create turtle world domination in the [ComputerCraft mod](http://www.computercraft.info/) for Minecraft.

I was hoping to supply a single turtle with fuel, start the program, and have it strip mine the world to produce replicas of itself, which would then coordinate to build a turtle empire.

In reality, I got about as far as a basic pathfinding system and inventory management. Very unfinished.
